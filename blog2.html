        <h2>Introduction</h2>
        <p>
            Coffee ‚Äî the aromatic, energizing drink we love today ‚Äî has a rich and fascinating history that spans continents and centuries. From ancient Ethiopian legends to global caf√©s, coffee has fueled revolutions, sparked social movements, and transformed into a cultural symbol.
        </p>

        <h1>üåç The Origins: Ethiopia‚Äôs Coffee Forests</h1>
        <p>
            Legend has it that in the 9th century, a goat herder named <b>Kaldi</b> in Ethiopia discovered coffee when he noticed his goats became unusually energetic after eating berries from a particular tree. Curious, Kaldi tried the berries himself and felt a renewed sense of energy.
        </p>
        <p>
            Word of this magical fruit spread quickly, eventually reaching <b>monks</b>, who used it to stay awake during long prayers. This was the first known use of coffee as a <b>stimulating beverage</b>.
        </p>

        <h1>‚ò™Ô∏è From Arabia to the World</h1>
        <p>
            By the 15th century, coffee was being cultivated and traded in the <b>Arabian Peninsula</b>. It became especially popular in Yemen, where it was brewed in homes and religious schools. By the 16th century, it had spread to <b>Persia, Egypt, Syria, and Turkey</b>.
        </p>

        <p>
            The world‚Äôs <b>first coffee houses</b>, known as <i>qahveh khaneh</i>, emerged in the Middle East. These places were hubs for <b>social interaction, music, political debates, and chess</b>, earning coffee the nickname <i>‚Äúthe wine of Islam.‚Äù</i>
        </p>
        
        <h1>üá™üá∫ Coffee Arrives in Europe</h1>
        <p>
            In the 17th century, coffee made its way to <b>Europe</b>, sparking both fascination and controversy. Some clergymen called it the <i>‚Äúbitter invention of Satan.‚Äù</i> But by the time <b>Pope Clement VIII</b> gave his blessing to coffee, it became wildly popular.
        </p>

        <p>
            <b>Coffee houses sprang up across Europe,</b> often referred to as <b>‚Äúpenny universities‚Äù</b> ‚Äî for the price of a cup, one could engage in stimulating conversation and intellectual debates.
        </p>

        <h1>üíº Coffee Fuels the Age of Enlightenment</h1>
        <p>
            Coffee became the drink of choice for <b>philosophers, scientists, and revolutionaries.</b> Famous thinkers like <b>Voltaire, Rousseau, and Newton</b> were known to frequent coffee houses. These spaces encouraged free thinking and even played a role in <b>political revolutions,</b> including the <b>French and American Revolutions.</b>
        </p>

        <h1>üå± Colonization and Coffee Cultivation</h1>
        <p>
            As demand for coffee soared, European colonial powers began cultivating it in tropical colonies. Plantations were set up in <b>India, Java (Indonesia), the Caribbean, and Latin America</b> ‚Äî often relying on enslaved or exploited labor.
        </p>
        <p>
            By the 18th century, coffee had become one of the <b>most valuable commodities</b> in global trade, second only to oil today.
        </p>
        
        <h1>üèôÔ∏è Coffee in the Modern World</h1>
        <p>
            Fast forward to the present ‚Äî coffee is a <b>global obsession.</b> Whether it's <b>Italian espresso, Turkish coffee, American drip,</b> or <b>Japanese cold brew,</b> every culture has put its own unique spin on coffee.
        </p>
        <p>
            <b>Coffee chains like Starbucks,</b> third-wave artisan caf√©s, and the rise of <b>home brewing and specialty beans</b> have revolutionized the way we enjoy coffee.
        </p>

        <h1>‚òï Why Does Coffee Matter?</h1>
        <p>Coffee is more than just a drink. It's:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>A<b>symbol of conversation and community</b></li>
            <li>A<b>bridge between cultures</b></li>
            <li>A<b>driver of economies</b></li>
            <li>A<b>fuel for creativity and change</b></li>
        </ul>
        <p>
